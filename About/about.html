                Welcome to <strong>Feastify</strong>, where every meal tells a story of passion, quality, and care.
                Founded in 2020, we started with a simple mission: to make delicious, restaurant-quality food
                accessible to everyone, right at their doorstep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our journey began in a small kitchen with a big dream. Today, we're proud to serve thousands of
                happy customers daily, but our commitment remains the same – to create meals that bring smiles and
                warmth to your table.
            </p>

            <p>
                We believe great food has the power to bring people together. That’s why we carefully select each
                ingredient, train our chefs to perfection, and ensure every order is prepared with the same love
                and attention we'd give to our own families.
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
                At Feastify, we're not just delivering food – we’re delivering happiness, one meal at a time.
            </p>
